example

If let's say you have zero experience, you just tie yourself to code and this is your first job interview.
You can say something along the lines of.
Well, I got really interested in coding a couple of years back when I would start this small little
side businesses, and I would hire developers and designers to build a website or an app for me.
And it was always a black box where I would pay this developer money and they will come back with a
product that I was never fully satisfied for.
So I started teaching myself how to code because I wanted to know how this black box works.
And the more I learned, the more I learned.
I became really interested, really engulfed in the programming landscape.
And I just started consuming as much information as I can, practicing as much as I can.
I started building projects and then this is where you can talk about some of your big portfolio projects.
And all of a sudden I started writing blog posts about technical subjects that got received very well.
And I guess what I'm trying to say is that through these projects and through these posts, every day
I'm becoming better and better as a coder to the point that now I feel very confident and being able
to be a valuable asset to your team, not just now, but even a year from now, where I expect my skills
to exponentially grow.
