# Step 2 Concrete Examples

- Exprlore examples
- Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
- Examples also provide sanity checks that you eventual solution works how it should
- User stories
- Unit test

1. Start with simple examples
2. Progress to more complex examples
3. Explore examples with empty inputs
4. Explore Examples with invalid inputs

- Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string

charCount('aaaaa') output {a:4}
charCount('hello') output {h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1}

- What if the input:
  charCount('hello my number is 7')
  charCount('Hello hi')
  charCount('')
