# Step 3 Break It Down

- Explicity write out the steps you need to take
- This forces you to think about the code you'll write before your write it,
  and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before
  you deive in and have to worry about details(example: languege syntax) as well

- Write a function which takes in a string and returns
  function charCount(str) {
  // do something
  // return an objwct with keys that are lowercase alphanumeric characters in the string; values should be the counts for those characters

  }

  function charCount(str) {
  // make object ti return at end
  // return over string
  // if char is a number/letter AND is key in object, add it and set value to 1
  // if char is a number/letter AND not in object, add it to the object and set value to 1
  // if char is something else(space, period, etc..) don't do anything

  // return object at end
  }
