# Elementary Sorting Algorithms

# What is sorting?

- Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection(example an array) so that the items are in some kind of order
- Examples
  - Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
  - Sorting names alphanetically
  - Sorting movies bases on release year
  - Sorting movies based on revenue

# Why do we need to learn this?

- Sorting is an increadibly common task, so it's good to know how it works
- There are many different techniques have thier own advantages and disadvantages

# Bubble sort, selection sort, and insetion sort are all roughly equivalent

- Sorting is fundamental
- All hava average time complexity that are quadratic
- We can due better... but we need more complex algorithms

# Intermediate Sorting Algorithms
