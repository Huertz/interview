# Elementary Sorting Algorithms

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort

# What is sorting?

- Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection(example an array) so that the items are in some kind of order
- Examples
  - Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
  - Sorting names alphanetically
  - Sorting movies bases on release year
  - Sorting movies based on revenue

# Why do we need to learn this?

- Sorting is an increadibly common task, so it's good to know how it works
- There are many different techniques have thier own advantages and disadvantages

# Bubble sort, selection sort, and insetion sort are all roughly equivalent

- Sorting is fundamental
- All hava average time complexity that are quadratic
- We can due better... but we need more complex algorithms

# Intermediate Sorting Algorithms

1. Merge Sort
2. Quick Sort
3. Radix Sort

# Why learn this?

- The sorting algorithms we've learned so far don't scale well
- Try out bubble sort on an array of 100,000 elements, it will take quite some time!

# Faster sorts

- There is a family of worting algorithms that can improve the time complexity form O(n^2) to O(n log n)
- There a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity
- There more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand
- Let's dive in!
