# Selection Sort

- Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted positions

# Pseudocode

- Store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far
- Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number
- If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new 'minimum' and continue until the end of the array
- If the 'minimum' is not the value(index) you are initially began with swap the two values
- Repeat this until with the next element until the array is sorted
